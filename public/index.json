is one of the leading causes of high data transmission latency and jitter on the Internet, which severely impacts the performance of low-latency interactive applications such as online streaming, cloud-based gaming/applications, Internet of Things (IoT) applications, voice over IP (VoIP), real-time video conferencing, and so forth. There is currently a pressing need for developing Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) congestion control algorithms and bottleneck queue management schemes that can collaboratively control/reduce end-to-end latency, thus ensuring optimal quality of service (QoS) and quality of experience (QoE) for users. This paper introduces a novel solution by experimentally integrate the low latency, low loss, and scalable throughput (L4S) architecture (specified by the IETF in RFC 9330) in FreeBSD framework with the asynchronous advantage actor-critic (A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm. The first phase involves incorporating a modified dual-queue coupled active queue management (AQM) system for L4S into the FreeBSD networking stack, enhancing queue management and mitigating latency and packet loss. The second phase employs A3C to adjust and fine-tune the system performance dynamically. Finally, we evaluate the proposed solution’s effectiveness through comprehensive experiments, comparing it with traditional AQM-based systems. This paper contributes to the advancement of machine learning (ML) for transport protocol research in the field. The experimental implementation and results presented in this paper are made available through our GitHub repositories.","tags":[null],"title":"Active Queue Management in L4S with Asynchronous Advantage Actor-Critic: A FreeBSD Networking Stack Perspective","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuo Wang and Jonathan Kua and Jiong Jin and Jason But and Prem Prakash Jayaraman and Suresh Palanisamy"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"3f0e7abaaa95fd399810c779a3f5c3f1","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/an_sdn-driven_active_queue_management_architecture/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/an_sdn-driven_active_queue_management_architecture/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"An SDN-driven Active Queue Management Architecture for Assisting Mission-Critical Traffic Flows in Industrial Automation Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sanjaya Khanal and Shiva Raj Pokhrel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"d46a86fb09ed06838314f17e4671ffec","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/analysis_modeling_and_design_of_personalized_digi/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/analysis_modeling_and_design_of_personalized_digi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Analysis, Modeling and Design of Personalized Digital Learning Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yang Cao and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Ye Zhu and Robin Doss and Gang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"68598b792096febd8ddef087490a7e84","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/automation_and_orchestration_of_zero_trust_archite/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/automation_and_orchestration_of_zero_trust_archite/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract Zero trust architecture (ZTA) is a paradigm shift in how we protect data, stay connected and access resources. ZTA is non-perimeter-based defence, which has been emerging as a promising revolution in the cyber security field. It can be used to continuously maintain security by safeguarding against attacks both from inside and outside of the network system. However, ZTA automation and orchestration, towards seamless deployment on real-world networks, has been limited to be reviewed in the existing literature. In this paper, we first identify the bottlenecks, discuss the background of ZTA and compare it with traditional perimeter-based security architectures. More importantly, we provide an in-depth analysis of state-of-the-art AI techniques that have the potential in the automation and orchestration of ZTA.

The existing teleoperation technologies have limitations in providing operator with spatial awareness and initiative control mechanism, making their applications difficult in tasks with high complexity and precision. This study implements the advancements from the Internet of Things (IoT) and Virtual Reality (VR) technology to improve the real-time teleoperation for industrial robots. The proposed design utilizes the benefits of the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol in conjunction with a cloud broker, which has not been addressed significantly in previous studies for teleoperation. This setup enables the system to efficiently handle substantial amounts of data in short periods of time, allowing for an uninterrupted user experience while maintaining a consistent connection regardless of distance. Real-time robot control is accomplished by tracking the user's hand movements with a VR controller while providing the user with visual feedback from the VR environment. The incorporation of VR technology intends to improve the intuitiveness of controlling robot operations, provide more responsive feedback, and improve the quality of work performed by operators. Practical experiments are conducted with an industrial robot to observe the performance against the system under different internet conditions and different QoS setups. The evaluation criteria primarily concern latency and accuracy. The experiment aims to evaluate the effectiveness and scalability of the suggested system and to offer significant insight into its advantages and limitations relative to existing control system through systematic investigation.","tags":[null],"title":"Effectiveness of IoT and VR for real-time teleoperation of industrial robots","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanika I Nanayakkara and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Gang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"acca88c3548c328b26dc9ca70fceab3f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/improving_federated_aggregation_with_deep_unfoldin/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/improving_federated_aggregation_with_deep_unfoldin/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Improving Federated Aggregation with Deep Unfolding Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi Xu and Fengguang Luan and Jonathan Kua and Haoyu Luo and Zhipeng Wang and Xiao Liu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"8304905ece6b413d5609364e948abff9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/multi-uav_collaborative_face_recognition_for_goods/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/multi-uav_collaborative_face_recognition_for_goods/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Multi-UAV Collaborative Face Recognition for Goods Receiver in Edge-Based Smart Delivery Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jonathan Kua and Brenton Fleming and Sebnem Ozer and Jeff Howe and Anwar Walid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"363ae7221cac508f579e42b09076f6d6","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/multipath_tcp_implementation_under_freebsd-13_for_/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/multipath_tcp_implementation_under_freebsd-13_for_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Multipath TCP implementation under FreeBSD-13 for pluggable machine learning models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Anwar Walid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"090b779cbbd7cbd3dcccb3d924554c4b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/on_large_language_model_based_joint_source_channel/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/on_large_language_model_based_joint_source_channel/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"On Large Language Model Based Joint Source Channel Coding for Semantic Communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shyam Kumar Shrestha and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jonathan Kua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"8eccd3de7c829d0b94ce0673bda1aaf5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/on_the_fairness_of_internet_congestion_control_ove/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/on_the_fairness_of_internet_congestion_control_ove/","section":"publication","summary":"For over forty years, TCP has been the main protocol for transporting data on the Internet. To improve congestion control algorithms (CCAs), delay bounding algorithms such as Vegas, FAST, BBR, PCC, and Copa have been developed. However, despite being designed to ensure fairness between data flows, these CCAs can still lead to unfairness and, in some cases, even cause data flow starvation in WiFi networks under certain conditions. We propose a new CCA switching solution that works with existing TCP and WiFi standards. This solution is offline and uses Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) trained on features such as noncongestive delay variations to predict and prevent extreme unfairness and starvation. Our DRL-driven approach allows for dynamic and efficient CCA switching. We have tested our design preliminarily in realistic datasets, ensuring that they support both fairness and efficiency over WiFi networks, which requires further investigation and extensive evaluation before online deployment.","tags":[null],"title":"On the Fairness of Internet Congestion Control over WiFi with Deep Reinforcement Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Belayet Hossain and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"77eb4eab7d1cd77c7ca06b189da63d8d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/orchestrating_smart_grid_demand_response_operation/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/orchestrating_smart_grid_demand_response_operation/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Orchestrating smart grid demand response operations with URLLC and MuZero learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Huanhuan Ge and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Zhenyu Liu and Jinlong Wang and Gang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"2337df6dcdf2f2cc0d2683be0c5e965a","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/pfl-dkd__modeling_decoupled_knowledge_fusion_with_/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/pfl-dkd__modeling_decoupled_knowledge_fusion_with_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"PFL-DKD: Modeling decoupled knowledge fusion with distillation for improving personalized federated learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amna Batool and Seng W Loke and Niroshinie Fernando and Jonathan Kua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"fff0535be847ecf5489668c94232a9fe","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/policy-based_management_of_human-device_and_device/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/policy-based_management_of_human-device_and_device/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Policy-based Management of Human-Device and Device-Device Interactions in IoT Collectives: A Simulation-based Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1704067200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1704067200,"objectID":"83f5ecc9f2a50c6ebfb2818133b22bf9","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/poster__orbital_zta_secure_satellite_communicatio/","publishdate":"2024-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/poster__orbital_zta_secure_satellite_communicatio/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Poster: Orbital ZTA!

A system's compliance with a specified security model, security standard, or specification is the focus of a security evaluation. The process of selecting the appropriate model for security assessment is determined by the type of cryptosystem. There are various models available. By enhancing data authentication and security for soft computing, this study proposes a novel technique for secure social internet of things (SSIoT) privacy analytics using post-quantum blockchain federated learning with encryption and trust analysis, the privacy analysis and data authentication. In terms of latency, QoS, energy consumption, packet loss rate, and other parameters, the experimental analysis is carried out. The purpose of the security analysis and performance evaluations is to demonstrate that the proposed scheme can satisfy the security requirements and enhance the FL model's performance. Federated learning is able to carry out effective machine learning (ML) with multiple participants while maintaining privacy of terminal personal data. Our proposed combination of federated learning as well as blockchain provides a solid foundation for future industrial Internet, as demonstrated by the numerical results.the proposed technique attainedenergy consumption of 55%, packet loss rate of 59%, QoS of 79%, Latency of 72%, network security analysis of 82%.","tags":[null],"title":"Post Quantum Secure Blockchain-based Federated Learning for Mobile Edge Computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Belayet Hossain and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"49a574605bdc2cb4a41f2171db24b395","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/privacy_cost_optimization_of_smart_meters_using_ur/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/privacy_cost_optimization_of_smart_meters_using_ur/","section":"publication","summary":"\u003cp\u003eThe work is related to the privacy of smart meter and the benifits of using URLLC in smart grid network.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[null],"title":"Privacy cost optimization of smart meters using URLLC and demand side energy trading","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Kua and Mohammad Belayet Hossain and Iynkaran Natgunanathan and Yong Xiang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"5c941e531b07f390e1f2f6057592a08e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/privacy_preservation_in_smart_meters__current_stat/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/privacy_preservation_in_smart_meters__current_stat/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent years have seen the rapid development of technologies in Smart Grids (SGs) to enhance electricity networks with digital and data communication technologies. SGs can proactively detect, react, and respond to dynamic changes in the network. SGs can also enhance the efficiency and reliability of electricity supplies and promote the integration of renewable energy sources. Smart Meters (SMs) are often seen as the first step to a successful implementation of SGs. While SMs enable Utility Providers and consumers to obtain near real-time information of energy consumption, they can also be exploited to infer sensitive consumer data. Therefore, privacy preservation in SMs is paramount in ensuring the widespread and successful deployment of SGs. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art SM privacy-preserving techniques published in the literature over the past decade. We categorize these techniques based on the attack types and their objectives. We aim to offer a unique perspective in this survey article through the lens of privacy preservation, cross-cutting the wide range of techniques presented in the literature. We conclude by identifying the challenges and highlighting key future research directions in the field.","tags":[null],"title":"Privacy preservation in smart meters: current status, challenges and future directions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sudeep Khanal and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Rebecca Dewey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"96960de9aa9de9d7e53cdf5078746a75","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/propagation_of_inequality__an_analysis_of_capabili/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/propagation_of_inequality__an_analysis_of_capabili/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Propagation of inequality: an analysis of capability development opportunities of Dalits in higher education on the Indian subcontinent","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ali Yavari and Harindu Korala and Dimitrios Georgakopoulos and Jonathan Kua and Hamid Bagha"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"27516dd664414604ca0e2ea124de15b0","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/sazgar_iot__a_device-centric_iot_framework_and_app/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/sazgar_iot__a_device-centric_iot_framework_and_app/","section":"publication","summary":"The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a fundamental role in monitoring applications; however, existing approaches relying on cloud and edge-based IoT data analysis encounter issues such as network delays and high costs, which can adversely impact time-sensitive applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an IoT framework called Sazgar IoT. Unlike existing solutions, Sazgar IoT leverages only IoT devices and IoT data analysis approximation techniques to meet the time-bounds of time-sensitive IoT applications. In this framework, the computing resources onboard the IoT devices are utilised to process the data analysis tasks of each time-sensitive IoT application. This eliminates the network delays associated with transferring large volumes of high-velocity IoT data to cloud or edge computers. To ensure that each task meets its application-specific time-bound and accuracy requirements, we employ approximation techniques for the data analysis tasks of time-sensitive IoT applications. These techniques take into account the available computing resources and optimise the processing accordingly. To evaluate the effectiveness of Sazgar IoT, experimental validation has been conducted. The results demonstrate that the framework successfully meets the time-bound and accuracy requirements of the COVID-19 citizen compliance monitoring application by effectively utilising the available IoT devices. The experimental validation further confirms that Sazgar IoT is an efficient and scalable solution for IoT data processing, addressing existing network delay issues for time-sensitive applications and significantly reducing the cost related to cloud and edge computing devices procurement, deployment, and maintenance.","tags":[null],"title":"Sazgar IoT: A device-centric IoT framework and approximation technique for efficient and scalable IoT data processing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mohammad Belayet Hossain and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"4820cccdc4dff27fa1865212250a4435","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/smart_grid_meets_urllc__a_federated_orchestration_/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/smart_grid_meets_urllc__a_federated_orchestration_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Smart grid meets URLLC: A federated orchestration with improved communication for efficient energy resources management","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amna Batool and Seng W Loke and Niroshinie Fernando and Jonathan Kua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"4175f18fbc42f86551d9e9ad7a18d57b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/software_engineering_for_smart_things_in_public_sp/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/software_engineering_for_smart_things_in_public_sp/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Software engineering for smart things in public spaces: Initial insights and challenges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandip Subedi and Shiva Pokhrel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"8b7e66785e00b6104b2993db78d9c2f3","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/studying_the_spatio-temporal_changes_of_urban_gree/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/studying_the_spatio-temporal_changes_of_urban_gree/","section":"publication","summary":"Green space refers to land areas covered primarily with vegetation, including parks, gardens, nature reserves, and other similar areas. These spaces offer various benefits such as supporting biodiversity, enhancing air and water quality, promoting mental and physical well-being, providing opportunities for recreation and social interaction, and improving the overall beauty of the environment. To assess the dynamics of green space in Pokhara Metropolitan City (PMC), maximum likelihood classification and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) methods were utilized to analyze satellite imagery. The study showed two distinct patterns of urban green space, with the green space in the central city gradually decreasing, while the nearby suburban and remote areas of PMC experienced an increase as agricultural land was transformed into grassland due to population migration. Consequently, the area of moderately healthy vegetation increased, while healthy vegetation decreased from 4926 hectares (10.61% of total area) to 2535 hectares (5.46% of total area). Additionally, the area of no vegetation such as urban areas increased from 1.8% to 2.17%. An accuracy assessment was used to validate the analyzed data, resulting in an overall accuracy of 81.91% and a Kappa coefficient of 0.63. The primary factors contributing to the loss of green spaces were urban growth and population growth within the inner metropolis. Therefore, it is crucial to maintain PMC's green areas and give more attention to this issue while developing municipal plans and policies in the future.","tags":[null],"title":"Studying the spatio-temporal changes of urban green space: A case study of Pokhara Metropolitan City","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"f1f40651c60cd0285bde0181e003eb12","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/understand-before-talk_ubt__a_semantic_communica/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/understand-before-talk_ubt__a_semantic_communica/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Understand-before-talk (UBT): A semantic communication approach to 6G networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1672531200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672531200,"objectID":"7081bfdfba36a5cc4b47237d999fcda5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/understanding_before_transmission_ubt__hashing-b/","publishdate":"2023-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/understanding_before_transmission_ubt__hashing-b/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Understanding before transmission (UBT): Hashing-based semantic communication model","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"6d99026b9e19e4fa43d5aadf147c7176","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/contact/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/contact/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Contact","type":"landing"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1666569600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1666569600,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/people/","publishdate":"2022-10-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"People","type":"landing"},{"authors":["Chathurika Ranaweera and Jonathan Kua and Imali Dias and Elaine Wong and Christina Lim and Ampalavanapillai Nirmalathas"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"fe62cc80a9a376d7cd670286553f0ae7","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/4g_to_6g__disruptions_and_drivers_for_optical_acce/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/4g_to_6g__disruptions_and_drivers_for_optical_acce/","section":"publication","summary":"The exponential growth of diverse smart mobile applications such as smart monitoring, holograms, and autonomous vehicles are driving mobile technologies toward a more intelligent and software-defined communication system. This growing demand has led to the next giant leap in next-generation wireless communication technology, i.e., sixth-generation (6G) mobile technology, which anticipates providing 1 Tbps data rates and ultralow latency over ubiquitous 3D coverage areas. However, the transport network, which connects hundreds of thousands of cell sites and the network core to enable intelligence, virtualization, and other key features of 6G, has not advanced enough to cater the dense cell deployment expected in future 6G networks. Because many aspects of 6G remain undefined, this provides us with the opportunity to take optical transport networks into design consideration to realize the benefits that 6G has to offer. To this end, in this paper, we present a comprehensive view on the role of optical access networks in supporting fourth-generation (4G), fifth-generation (5G), and beyond wireless technologies. In particular, we discuss design and deployment strategies and their challenges when using optical access as a transport solution during the evolution of wireless access technologies. For this purpose, we first identify how an optical access network is used to support high-capacity transport networks in 4G, followed by the challenges that 5G brought into optical transport networks and its diverse solutions. We conclude the paper by providing insights into how an optical transport network can be designed to support 6G.","tags":[null],"title":"4G to 6G: Disruptions and drivers for optical access","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Himesh Welgama and Kevin Lee and Jonathan Kua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"a823d1887a25799f29e320be1584cbca","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/a_framework_for_seamless_offloading_in_iot_applica/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/a_framework_for_seamless_offloading_in_iot_applica/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"A framework for seamless offloading in IoT applications using edge and cloud computing","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Carey Williamson"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"8bd1c08939af0242d5670bf6e7f5700b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/a_game-theoretic_rent-seeking_framework_for_improv/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/a_game-theoretic_rent-seeking_framework_for_improv/","section":"publication","summary":"There is no well-defined utility function for existing multipath TCP algorithms.

The existing transmission control protocol (TCP)-based data networking schemes for DEL are application-agnostic and fail to deliver adjustments according to application layer requirements. As a result, they introduce massive excess time and undesired issues such as unfairness and stragglers. Other prior mitigation solutions have significant limitations as they balance data flow rates from workers across paths but often incur imbalanced backlogs when the paths exhibit variance, causing stragglers. To facilitate a more productive DEL, we develop a hybrid multipath TCP (MPTCP) by combining model-based and deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based MPTCP for DEL that strives to realize quicker iteration of DEL and better fairness (by ameliorating stragglers). Hybrid MPTCP essentially integrates two radical TCP developments: i) successful existing model-based MPTCP control strategies and ii) advanced emerging DRL-based techniques, and introduces a novel hybrid MPTCP data transport for easing the communication of Agg-Avg process. Extensive emulation results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid MPTCP can overcome excess time consumption and ameliorate the application layer unfairness of DEL effectively without injecting additional inconstancy and stragglers.\u003c/p\u003e","tags":[null],"title":"Fair and efficient distributed edge learning with hybrid multipath TCP","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rongxin Xu and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Qiujun Lan and Gang Li"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"899d736fae54345391d3ce353a14f20b","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/fair-bfl__flexible_and_incentive_redesign_for_bloc/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/fair-bfl__flexible_and_incentive_redesign_for_bloc/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"FAIR-BFL: Flexible and incentive redesign for blockchain-based federated learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ashritha Srikande and Mohammad Belayet Hossain and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"4ec8fd9b73548702cba9e97870a14ade","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/insights_on_smart_farming_with_low_orbit_satellite/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/insights_on_smart_farming_with_low_orbit_satellite/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Insights on smart farming with low orbit satellite","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Michel Mandjes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"968187d933ef9c902883bc2c3309f9dd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/internet_of_drones__improving_multipath_tcp_over_w/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/internet_of_drones__improving_multipath_tcp_over_w/","section":"publication","summary":"We consider multipath TCP (MPTCP) flows over the data networking dynamics of IEEE 802.11ay for drone surveillance of areas using high-definition video streaming. Mobility-induced handoffs are critical in IEEE 802.11ay (because of the smaller coverage of mmWaves), which adversely affects the performance of such data streaming flows. As a result of the enhanced 802.11ay network events and features (triggered by beamforming, channel bonding, MIMO, mobility-induced handoffs, channel sharing, retransmissions, etc.), the time taken for packets to travel end-to-end in 802.11ay are inherently time-varying. Several fundamental assumptions inherent in stochastic TCP models, including Poisson arrivals of packets, Gaussian process, and parameter certainty, are challenged by the improved data traffic dynamics over IEEE 802.11ay networks. The MPTCP model’s state estimation differs largely from the actual network values. We develop a new data-driven stochastic framework to address current deficiencies of MPTCP models and design a foundational architecture for intelligent multipath scheduling (at the transport layer) considering lower layer (hybrid) beamforming. At the heart of our cross-layer architecture is an intelligent learning agent for actuating and interfacing, which learns from experience optimal packet cloning, scheduling, aggregation, and beamforming using successful features of multi-armed bandits and federated learning. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can estimate and optimize jointly (explore–exploit) and is more practicable for designing the next generation of low-delay and robust MPTCP models.","tags":[null],"title":"Internet of Drones: Improving multipath TCP over WiFi with federated multi-armed bandits for limitless connectivity","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sumarga Kumar Sah Tyagi and Pratik Goswami and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Amrit Mukherjee"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"bcd9ec131e7f08451d63dea4a938cb03","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/internet_of_things_for_healthcare__an_intelligent_/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/internet_of_things_for_healthcare__an_intelligent_/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Internet of things for healthcare: an intelligent and energy efficient position detection algorithm","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"0abb1c90d655fc884e765ff7f744df35","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/learning_from_data_streams_for_automation_and_orch/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/learning_from_data_streams_for_automation_and_orch/","section":"publication","summary":"AbstractEstablished methods of communication are based mainly on Shannon’s theory of information, which purposefully overlooks semantic elements of communication. The future wireless technology should promise to facilitate many services, based on content, needs, and semantics, precisely customized to network capabilities. This gave rise to significant concern for Semantic Communication (SC), a novel paradigm considering the message’s meaning during transmission. Federated learning (FL) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) are the two emerging distributed and artificially intelligent approaches that provide diverse and possibly massive network coverage for data-driven SC solutions of industry 4.0 automation. Although SC is still in an early development stage, FL-empowered architecture has been recognized as one of the most promising solutions to meet the ubiquitous intelligence in the anticipated sixth-generation (6G) networks. This paper identifies industry 4.0 automation needs that drive the convergence of artificial intelligence and 6G for learning from data streams. We develop a novel SC framework based on the FL and A3C networks and discuss its potential along with transfer learning to address most of the new difficulties anticipated in 6G for industrial communication networks.

Constant real-time water level monitoring prior to a flooding event can minimise damages and casualties. Many of the currently deployed water level monitoring systems typically use a combination of float-type or ultrasonic sensing, image processing and computer vision techniques. However, these systems incur high computing and hardware requirements, which hinder the deployment of such systems in resource-constrained and low-cost environments. The recent development of technologies empowered by the Internet of things (IoT) and edge computing have enabled real-time systems to be deployed at a significantly lower cost and a far more distributed manner. In this paper, we propose an architecture for flood monitoring using RGB-D cameras with stereoscopic capabilities to measure the water level in an open environment. Our system uses image preprocessing techniques to account for chromatic aberration due to overexposure, followed by postprocessing before the depth readings are extracted. Data processing and water level information extraction are entirely performed on an edge computing device, therefore greatly reducing the amount of data transmitted to the cloud server. We practically implemented and experimentally validated this system in the real world, under a wide range of weather and lighting conditions. Our results showed promising outcomes and demonstrated the applicability of our proposed system in a wider context.","tags":[null],"title":"Real-time flood monitoring with computer vision through edge computing-based Internet of Things","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amna Batool and Seng W Loke and Niroshinie Fernando and Jonathan Kua"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"d87a2f3c20d1dd0ff083d384461c6454","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/towards_a_policy_development_methodology_for_human/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/towards_a_policy_development_methodology_for_human/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Towards a Policy Development Methodology for Human-Centred IoT Collectives","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed Falah and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Lei Pan and Anthony de Souza-Daw"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1640995200,"objectID":"10a5dea88bcfc4fead1882716ba61337","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/towards_enhanced_pdf_maldocs_detection_with_featur/","publishdate":"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/towards_enhanced_pdf_maldocs_detection_with_featur/","section":"publication","summary":"AbstractIn this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of a large corpus of PDF maldocs to identify the key set of significantly important features and help in maldoc detection. Existing industry-based tools for the detection are inefficient and cannot prevent PDF maldocs because they are generic and depend primarily on a signature-based approach. Besides, several other methods developed by academics suffer heavily from reduced effectiveness. The feature-set using machine learning classifiers is prone to various known attacks, such as mimicry and parser confusion. Also, we discover that increasingly more malicious files i) contain evasive and obfuscated JavaScript code, ii) include hidden contents (mostly outside the objects), iii) have a corrupted document structure, and iv) usually contain short JavaScript code blocks. We utilise maldoc attacks’ evolution over a decade to highlight the essential features (e.g., concept drifts) that impact detectors and classifiers.","tags":[null],"title":"Towards enhanced PDF

For each packet transmission over dynamically allocated network radio resources, the conventional random access protocols are based on a request- rant scheme. This induces excessive latency and necessitates reliable control signalling, resulting overhead. To address these problems, grant-free (GF) solutions are proposed in the fifth-generation (5G) new radio (NR). In this paper, an overview and vision of the state-of-the-art in enabling GF URLLC are presented. In particular, we first provide a comprehensive review of NR specifications and techniques for URLLC, discuss underlying principles, and highlight impeding issues of enabling GF URLLC. Furthermore, we explain two key phenomena of massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) (i.e., channel hardening and favorable propagation) and build several deep insights into how celebrated mMIMO features can be exploited to enhance the performance of GF URLLC. Moving further ahead, we examine the potential of cell-free (CF) mMIMO and analyze its distinctive features and benefits over mMIMO to resolve GF URLLC issues. Finally, we identify future research directions and challenges in enabling GF URLLC with CF mMIMO.\u003c/div\u003e","tags":[null],"title":"Enabling grant-free URLLC: An overview of principle and enhancements by massive MIMO","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jinho Choi and Jihong Park and Shiva Pokhrel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"b180a294660ba820b82b08fdc9e0d315","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/explore-before-talk__multichannel_selection_divers/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/explore-before-talk__multichannel_selection_divers/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Explore-before-talk: Multichannel selection diversity for uplink transmissions in machine-type communication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ahmed Falah and Lei Pan and Shamsul Huda and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Adnan Anwar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"275bc8c1ec957bcb9dfc14347f477a0d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/improving_malicious_pdf_classifier_with_feature_en/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/improving_malicious_pdf_classifier_with_feature_en/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Improving malicious PDF classifier with feature engineering: A data-driven approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Kua and Seng W Loke and Chetan Arora and Niroshinie Fernando and Chathurika Ranaweera"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"d7aebdf8866d4574cef9759c55df2f9f","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/jonathan_kua/internet_of_things_in_space__a_review_of_opportuni/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/jonathan_kua/internet_of_things_in_space__a_review_of_opportuni/","section":"publication","summary":"Recent scientific and technological advancements driven by the Internet of Things (IoT), Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), distributed computing and data communication technologies have opened up a vast range of opportunities in many scientific fields—spanning from fast, reliable and efficient data communication to large-scale cloud/edge computing and intelligent big data analytics. Technological innovations and developments in these areas have also enabled many opportunities in the space industry. The successful Mars landing of NASA’s Perseverance rover on 18 February 2021 represents another giant leap for humankind in space exploration. Emerging research and developments of connectivity and computing technologies in IoT for space/non-terrestrial environments is expected to yield significant benefits in the near future. This survey paper presents a broad overview of the area and provides a look-ahead of the opportunities made possible by IoT and space-based technologies. We first survey the current developments of IoT and space industry, and identify key challenges and opportunities in these areas. We then review the state-of-the-art and discuss future opportunities for IoT developments, deployment and integration to support future endeavors in space exploration.","tags":[null],"title":"Internet of things in space: A review of opportunities and challenges from satellite-aided computing to digitally-enhanced space living","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Anwar Walid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"a717ddc5534cf4c4601de02b291e54d5","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/learning_to_harness_bandwidth_with_multipath_conge/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/learning_to_harness_bandwidth_with_multipath_conge/","section":"publication","summary":"Multipath TCP (MPTCP) has emerged as a facilitator for harnessing and pooling available bandwidth in wireless/wireline communication networks and in data centers. Existing implementations of MPTCP such as, Linked Increase Algorithm (LIA), Opportunistic LIA (OLIA) and BAlanced LInked Adaptation (BALIA) include separate algorithms for congestion control and packet scheduling, with pre-selected control parameters. We propose a Deep Q-Learning (DQL) based framework for joint congestion control and packet scheduling for MPTCP. At the heart of the solution is an intelligent agent for interface, learning and actuation, which learns from experience optimal congestion control and scheduling mechanism using DQL techniques with policy gradients. We provide a rigorous stability analysis of system dynamics which provides important practical design insights. In addition, the proposed DQL-MPTCPalgorithm utilizes the ‘recurrent neural network’ and integrates it with ‘long short-term memory’ for continuously i) learning dynamic behavior of subflows (paths) and ii) responding promptly to their behavior using prioritized experience replay. With extensive emulations, we show that the proposed DQL-based MPTCP algorithm outperforms MPTCP LIA, OLIA and BALIA algorithms. Moreover, the DQL-MPTCP algorithm is robust to time-varying network characteristics and provides dynamic exploration and exploitation of paths. The revised version is to appear in IEEE Trans. in Mobile Computing soon.\u003cbr\u003e","tags":[null],"title":"Learning to harness bandwidth with multipath congestion control and scheduling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahyar Nemati and Behrouz Maham and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"fc535da7362dbb47b3a1c1f93748ec9e","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/modeling_ris_empowered_outdoor-to-indoor_communica/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/modeling_ris_empowered_outdoor-to-indoor_communica/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Modeling RIS empowered outdoor-to-indoor communication in mmWave cellular networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mahyar Nemati and Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Jinho Choi"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"6c88df7b96fd5f2695acd54db3957ca2","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/modelling_data_aided_sensing_with_uavs_for_efficie/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/modelling_data_aided_sensing_with_uavs_for_efficie/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Modelling data aided sensing with UAVs for efficient data collection","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Sahil Garg"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"257f45ed4663a1e5c1f79f45a9ba4ded","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/multipath_communication_with_deep_q-network_for_in/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/multipath_communication_with_deep_q-network_for_in/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Multipath communication with deep Q-network for industry 4.0 automation and orchestration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Lei Pan and Neeraj Kumar and Robin Doss and Hai L Vu"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"edb07259f635cd99dcacfe67b857f22d","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/multipath_tcp_meets_transfer_learning__a_novel_edg/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/multipath_tcp_meets_transfer_learning__a_novel_edg/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[null],"title":"Multipath TCP meets transfer learning: A novel edge-based learning for industrial IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shiva Raj Pokhrel and Neeraj Kumar and Anwar Walid"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"8aa5e64af4fbf215bac420435dd0b3bd","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/on_ultra-reliable_low_latency_multipath_tcp_for_co/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/shiva_raj_pokhrel/on_ultra-reliable_low_latency_multipath_tcp_for_co/","section":"publication","summary":"Connected Autonomous Vehicles (CAVs) are Not-So-Futuristic.

Commercial streaming services such as Netflix and YouTube use proprietary HTTP-based adaptive streaming (HAS) techniques to deliver content to consumers worldwide. MPEG recently developed Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH) as a unifying standard for HAS-based streaming. In DASH systems, streaming clients employ adaptive bitrate (ABR) algorithms to maximise user Quality of Experience (QoE) under variable network conditions. In a typical Internet-enabled home, video streams have to compete with diverse application flows for the last-mile Internet Service Provider (ISP) bottleneck capacity. Under such circumstances, ABR algorithms will only act upon the fraction of the network capacity that is available, leading to possible QoE degradation. We have previously explored chunklets as an approach orthogonal to ABR algorithms, which uses parallel connections for intra-video chunk retrieval. Chunklets effectively make more bandwidth available for ABR algorithms in the presence of cross-traffic, especially in environments where Active Queue Management (AQM) schemes such as Proportional Integral controller Enhanced (PIE) and FlowQueue-Controlled Delay (FQ-CoDel) are deployed. However, chunklets consume valuable server/middlebox resources which typically handle hundreds of thousands of requests/connections per second. In this article, we propose ‘adaptive chunklets’ -- a novel chunklet enhancement that dynamically tunes the number of concurrent connections. We demonstrate that the combination of adaptive chunklets and FQ-CoDel is the most effective strategy. Our experiments show that adaptive chunklets can reduce the number of connections by almost 30% and consume almost 8% less bandwidth than fixed chunklets while providing the same QoE.
