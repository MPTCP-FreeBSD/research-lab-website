# summary: A research project enhancing low-latency, lossless, and scalable internet service delivery using the FreeBSD networking stack.

abstract: |
  This project, supported by the APNIC Foundation, focuses on implementing the IETF-defined L4S (Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable Throughput) architecture within the FreeBSD kernel to support real-time, congestion-aware internet applications. The work involves modifying queue management systems and using reinforcement learning to dynamically optimize performance for modern digital services including cloud gaming, real-time video, and industrial IoT.

### Project Overview 


This project explores the integration of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) and Large Language Models (LLMs) with the Low Latency, Low Loss, and Scalable Throughput (L4S) architecture to improve Internet congestion control. Hosted at Deakin University and funded by the APNIC Foundation, the project implements modular congestion control algorithms within FreeBSD, evaluates them on custom-built testbeds, and disseminates experimental results, software and datasets to the wider community.

---

### Key Outcomes

- DRL-based Multipath TCP (MPTCP) and AQM modules implemented in FreeBSD  
- Public testbed infrastructure available for reproducible experimentation  
- Peer-reviewed publications and ongoing contributions in academic/industry conferences  
- Student internships, mentoring, and curriculum integration for skill development  
- Ongoing industry and research partnerships
